RailsWidget
===========

Allows you to group your client-side assets into distributable "widgets".

* Include assets and render partials to layout with a single <tt>widget</tt> call
* Share a common options hash between all of your rendered assets
* Supports flash, images, javascripts, stylesheets, and textarea template (jst) assets
* Widgets can inherit

You can also use it to organize your assets however you like (layout, action, etc).
